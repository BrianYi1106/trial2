    <h1>
        Design Brief
    </h1>

    <h3>
        Goal of the design
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Every client comes in with different goals, so it’s important to know what they want to achieve from this design project. Goals tend to align with the specific kind of project being worked on, such as web design, logo design, ad campaign design and more.
        
        Most clients’ goals include:
    </p>
                <li>increasing customer engagement (clicks, likes, comments)</li>
                <li>boosting traffic (both foot and online traffic)</li>
                <li>boosting a new product or service’s release</li>
                <li>changing/ improving brand image</li>
                <li>boosting competitive abilities</li>
                <li>forging brand differentiation</li>
                <li>increasing sales</li>
                <li>simplifying the customer experience</li>
                <li>improving sustainability</li>
                <li>forging a new brand</li>
                <li>and more.</li>
        
    <p>
        Knowing these goals helps the designer identify the best ways to achieve the kind of product design the client is thinking of.
        Besides understanding the goals of the client and his company, clients should also explain how they expect the new product design to help achieve the said goals. This is not only a moment of reflection for clients but a very valuable source of information for the designer’s future choices.

    <h3>
        Market analysis
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        A market analysis studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special market within a special industry. It is part of the industry analysis and thus in turn of the global environmental analysis. Through all of these analyses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of a company can be identified. Finally, with the help of a SWOT analysis, adequate business strategies of a company will be defined.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Competitor analysis
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Some companies are so popular and famous that their direct competitors are already known by the general public. Many companies don’t have that luxury. In the end, designers may not always know automatically their new client’s major competition. That’s why a client’s major competitors are requested for in the design brief.
        Outwitting and differentiating from the competition aren’t the only reasons for this question though; competitors can also be essential sources of inspiration, judging by what’s working for them design-wise and vice versa.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        User analysis
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        In systems design, user analysis is the means by which scientists, engineers and technical writers determine the characteristics of users which will influence the development of software systems or other technological products. During the process, developers in technical fields gather information about users of their products through interviews, focus groups and other forms of qualitative research. This is typically performed by forming use cases based upon the actual work flow tasks which the users will perform while using a given piece of technology. Such analyses are vital to the composition of software documentation.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Target audience
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Every design brief must feature a section on the target audience; even basic design brief examples from the internet always feature one. The target audience is the market, niche or group of people that the product will be marketed to.
        The target audience for any product directly influences the specifics of a product’s design, because the design needs to speak to the people it is being marketed to. That’s why two products may feature different materials and colors in their packaging and branding despite being similar. In answering this question, the designer should offer specifics such as:
        <li>
            Whether it’s a B2B (Business to business such as cloud services) or B2C (business to customers such as an iPhone) product, or both.
        </li>
        <li>
            The age, sex, income, location, education of the target population
        </li>
        <li>
            The interests, values, beliefs of that target population
        </li>
        <li>
            At least two sample buyer personas.
        </li>
        
    </p>    

    <h3>
        Outsourcing
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Some clients hand out different aspects of the project to other creators, such as photography and copy text. Under this question, a client should make it clear if the designer is expected to provide all these services, or whether they’ve been handed out to other service providers. This also helps the designer plan ahead, depending on when the other service providers submit their work.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Design outline
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        In this section you want to describe what your design is going to look like. What are you making? What is it for? What tools are you using? How will it happen? Tell a rough outline of your design project.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Deliverables
    </h3>
     
    <p>
        What does the client expect the designer to offer in the final package? This can include photos, text, illustrations, logos, and more. The client should list all of these deliverables and their submission date.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Timeline
    </h3>
   
    <p>
        The client has to reveal the date on which he expects the project to start. This also helps with tracking working hours, especially if the project is to be paid by the hour. All design briefs and design brief templates feature a section on submission deadlines, mostly to avert the danger of late submissions and their consequences. Some clients prefer to have each deliverable submitted on a particular date, while others prefer to have everything delivered in one whole package. Clients can come up with a specific date(s) depending on their needs on the project, or they can come up with a date after discussing with the designer how long it might take to complete the project.
